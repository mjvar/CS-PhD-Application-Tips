A repository of resources for PhD applicants, with a focus on CS-specific advice.
# General Advice
A meta-note on application advice: PhD applications are very personalized compared to undergrad (or even masters) admissions. At many universities, what matters most is finding an advisor who wants you as their PhD student. However, different advisors can look for very different things - some advisors care a lot about grades while others barely look at them, some are looking for students who will fit in well with the existing group, some prefer to recruit from specific undergrad institutions, etc. Thus, while it is helpful to read peoples' advice, there is no single correct way to go about PhD admissions. It also goes without saying that the things I say here are my own personal opinion and might not apply perfectly to your situation. Still, I hope it helps to hear my perspective!

It's worth placing stronger emphasis on advice from people within your field or subfield, because it's probably more locally applicable. Also, if a potential advisor has advice for PhD applications (e.g. on their website or blog), pay close attention to it - it probably hints at what they're looking for in applicants to their own labs.

# Choosing Where to Apply
Unfortunately, applying for PhDs can get prohibitively expensive. If application fees pose a significant barrier to you, there are a couple ways around it. Many universities offer fee waiver programs for applicants from certain underrepresented groups, so check the websites for each place you're considering. Additionally, check out the fantastic [Queer in AI Graduate Application Aid Award.](https://www.queerinai.com/grad-app-aid) Between fee waivers and the QAI award I ended up paying less than half of what I originally would've.

There's a lot about PhD admissions that is completely out of your control - for example, even if you're a fantastic applicant, your prospective advisor may not have funding or their lab might be full. Some programs just decide to accept less students one year because they got more students than they expected last year. For this reason, I would recommend applying to as many places as you can, constrained by your ability to still write quality SoPs and your ability to pay for application costs. If possible, you could try to plan your courses so that you have a lighter workload during the semester you apply for grad school (I did this and it enabled me to apply to way more places). 

Aside from cost and time, you'll also want to apply to programs you would actually go to. That's a very personal decision, but here's a (non-exhaustive) laundry list of factors you might want to think about: location, prestige, how well you see yourself getting along with your advisor, how reputable your advisor is, how closely your research interests match the faculty at that program, whether immigration is a possibility in the long term (for international students), the funding structure throughout the PhD, the vibes of the current students... You get the picture.

# Recommendation Letters

- [Advice to Students Asking for Recommendation Letters by Rajit Manohar](http://vlsi.cornell.edu/~rajit/recletters.html)
  
Ask for recs early on - like, multiple months before the deadline! You don't want your recommenders to cram your letters. You will have to be the one to keep track of which letters your recommenders have submitted already. Don't be afraid to gently follow up with your writers if needed.

When you ask someone to write letters for you, **make sure you ask if they are comfortable writing you a strong recommendation letter.** This gives them an out to say if they aren't comfortable writing you a strong letter - which is **good for you, because then you can ask someone else who will write you a strong letter.**

The best letters are **strong research letters** that come from a professor who knows you really well and can vouch for your research potential in detail. Letters from profs who you took classes with typically don't count for much no matter how positive they are. Not all of your rec letters need to be strong research letters - 1-2 of these can often be enough (though more is always better).

I personally received a lot of conflicting advice on how the SoP should be written. Having people read through your SoP and give feedback can be really helpful. However, at the end of the day it is *your* statement about why you want to do a PhD, and you know best the answer to that question. Get lots of feedback, but always remember you can choose which feedback to listen to!

# Contacting Professors
Emailing potential advisors ahead of the app deadlines can help you stand out/establish rapport. However, it is not a hard requirement. If you are doing it, make sure your emails leave a good impression by writing them well and tailoring them to each professor (no form emails!)

You may get a range of responses from emailing advisors - they may not reply, they may send a polite message along the lines of "I look forward to reading your application", or they may be interested in meeting you and talking more. Getting meetings is a slightly positive signal since it means people are willing to spend time on getting to know you. That being said, don't put too much weight on any of these responses - I was accepted by some advisors who didn't reply to me, and was rejected by some advisors who I had Zoom calls with.
# Mentorship
Many departments offer mentorship programs for applicants. Usually, this entails being matched with a current student who can provide feedback on your application, SoP, etc. Look for these early on as many operate on a rolling basis.
